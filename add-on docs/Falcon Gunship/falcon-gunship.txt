To gun your ship these two add-ons are also required

Stall speed is somewhere around 135mph @ sea level if you're really pitching up (50 or 60 degrees).

Begins to get shaky above M 2.0 near sea level - trim controls are indispensable.

Engines are overpowered to provide the thrust necessary to match target velocities for Warp Drive maneuvers.

I use WarpDrive MFD Mk2 https://www.orbithangar.com/searchid.php?ID=2297

Fly-by-Wire's http://www.orbithangar.com/searchid.php?ID=3223 exponential scale for for main, retro and hover engine input can be put to good use for this vessel.

RCS is overpowered for increased translational maneuverability. For docking, Ctrl + Numpad is necessary.

Attitude MFD V3.2 https://www.orbithangar.com/searchid.php?ID=3165 helps too.

Four docking ports - docking port 3 is the gangway access.

Basic Virtual Cockpit - MFD's but no HUD.

Animation Controls (Num Lock must be off)

LShift + Numpad 1 = Radar Dish Deploy
LShift + Numpad 3 = Radar Dish Rotate
LShift + Numpad 5 = Fire Blasters
LShift + Numpad 7 = Rotate Top Turret
LShift + Numpad 9 = Rotate Bottom Turret

g = Gear
k = Gangway

j = Jettison


...


Known Issues:

If radar is rotated while it is deploying, or turret animation is 'fired' while rotating, mesh will get out of place and look funny.

The gangway and landing gear i added are crude but, hopefully, everything fits together without distracting too much from the original mesh.

There are only three landing struts but the landing points for them are correct.

MFDs in Virtual Cockpit are subject to shadows.

To spawn the FalconGunship with the Scenario Editor, the vessel name must be 'FalconGunship'.

For Gunship Script MFD, the mesh for the top turret is upside down - the only way i was able to aim properly, while the turret had focus.

If you don't care about being able to use that turret independently, there are alternative pos & dir figures (commented out) in the, provided, CreateGunAttchs.lua script.

Thank you to Mr. Kyle Wiegers for giving permission to lean against his beautiful work. I found his Star Destroyer and Millenium Falcon-3
http://www.orbithangar.com/searchid.php?ID=1101 add on when I first discovered Orbiter 50216 and was running Windows 2K at something like 450MHz with 512MB of memory and a 64MB NVIDIA video card. The MilleniumF3.msh was so easy on my frame-rates that I became enamored with it.

Over the while I very liberally tweaked the numbers for this vessel and then discovered I could add landing gear and an animated gangway using Anim8or http://www.anim8or.com/ , Mesh Wizard 1.9d    
http://www.orbithangar.com/searchid.php?ID=2740 and Vinka's Spacecraft http://francophone.dansteph.com/?page=addon&id=202

The atmospheric flight model is based largely on the Cactus Kitten https://www.orbithangar.com/searchid.php?ID=2186  I did use Shipedit.exe to get COG, CROSS_SECTION, PMI and then promptly fudged with the results. Actually, I made a copy of the mesh without the radar dish or turrets, ran the numbers on that and then sculpted them further still, using a math I call "I want this".

Also thank you
